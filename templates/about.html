<h2>About</h2>
<p>
    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the king of the Lonely Mountain when
    Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
    Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
    Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
    action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to
    leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill in to their party.

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>
            In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely
            Mountain. Early in his youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the
            dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated
            when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with one of the Dwarven armies
            beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree
            branch found on the floor as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield", which would remain with him
            even in death.

        <h3>Fíli and Kíli</h3>
        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews
            of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thror. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his
            long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves on the Quest of Erebor.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the youngest Dwarves, Fíli and Kíli had the sharpest eyes so they were often sent scouting or searching.
            They found the Goblins' cave in the Misty Mountains.

        <h3>Óin</h3>
        <p>
            Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. He usually wore a
            brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield,
            and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown
            hood. Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely
            Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company. He fought
            in and survived the Battle of the Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain along with many
            other dwarves of The Company of Thorin.

        <h3>Glóin</h3>
        <p>
            In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War of
            the Dwarves and Orcs. In TA 2941, Glóin and his brother Óin, along with his cousins Dwalin and Balin,
            were among the Dwarves accompanying Thorin and Company during their quest to the Lonely Mountain to
            recapture it from the Dragon Smaug. He was noted for his skills with a tinderbox, and, along with his
            brother Óin, was usually the one told to get a fire started whenever the Dwarves made camp. Gloin also
            fought in the Battle of the Five Armies.[1] After the battle, he settled in the Lonely Mountain.

        <h3>Balin</h3>
        <p>
            Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger
            brother named Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely
            Mountain. Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the
            Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA
            2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the father of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the Lonely
            Mountain himself, but Thráin was captured and lost.

            Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor, Dwalin was the son of Fundin
            and younger brother of Balin. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin
            accompanied Thrain the Second and Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.

        <h3>Ori</h3>
        <p>
            Ori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains for many years. In the year TA 2941, Ori
            became a member of Thorin's Company and travelled with Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the other
            dwarves on the quest for the Lonely Mountain, culminating in the death of Smaug. Finally, he and the
            other dwarves of Thorin's Company fought in the Battle of the Five Armies, and he survived it.

            Before The Quest of Erebor, Dori lived in Thorin's home in the northern Blue Mountains with Nori and
            Ori. In TA 2941, Dori and his two brothers became part of Thorin and Company, befriending Bilbo Baggins
            and traveling with him in search of Smaug's treasure at the Lonely Mountain.

            Whilst he was a descendant of the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, Bifur was not of Durin's Folk. Most of his
            familial relations are unclear, and what is known of his parentage is very little. He and his family
            were driven out of their home in the Lonely Mountain by the Dragon Smaug, and were forced to live in
            exile, where the Dwarf warrior worked as a toy maker. Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a new life in
            the Blue Mountains, he continued his life as a toy maker.

            Bofur was a descendant of the Dwarves of Rhudaur, but was not of Durin's Folk. He and his family hailed
            from the Blue Mountains. As such, they felt less strongly about the quest to reclaim the Lonely
            Mountain from the dragon Smaug, more interested in the adventure than a home they'd never seen.

        <h3>Bombur</h3>
        <p>
            Bombur's parentage is unknown; the only familial connections mentioned are his brother Bofur and his
            cousin Bifur. Bombur was not of Durin's line although he was descended from Dwarves of Moria. His birth
            year is also unknown, however, from Bilbo Baggins' account from the quest to Erebor it is known that
            the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of the 13 "by some fifty years" and that after Thorin had
            been captured, Balin was "the eldest left". Since Fíli was born in TA 2859 and Balin was born in TA
            2763, this would put Bombur's birth between 2763 and 2809, and he would have been between 132 and 178
            years old during the quest to Erebor. Prior to the quest Bombur probably lived in the Blue Mountains
            with Thorin after the loss of Thráin II.

        </p>
        <p>
            Gandalf suggested Bilbo Baggins to be hired by Thorin and Company to be their burglar in the Quest of
            Erebor, and later fought in the Battle of the Five Armies. Bilbo was also one of the bearers of the One
            Ring, and the first to voluntarily give it up, although with some difficulty. He wrote many of his
            adventures in a book he called There and Back Again. Bilbo adopted Frodo Baggins to be his heir after
            his parents, Drogo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck, drowned in the Brandywine River.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bilbo was the first Hobbit to become famous in the world at large, and was one of the few to visit the
